# Hangman Game
This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python.


## Description
Hangman is a word guessing game where the player attempts to guess a secret word, one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts and the hangman is fully drawn.

## Features
- Random selection of words from a predefined list.
- Display of hangman ASCII art corresponding to the number of incorrect guesses.
- Visual representation of guessed letters and remaining attempts.
- Easy-to-understand user interface.
